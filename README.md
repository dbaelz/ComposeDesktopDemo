# About
Demo repository to test and experiment with Compose for Desktop.
It contains topics I played around, implementations I did to answer questions
from people and all in all a lot of basic Compose stuff. 

Feel free to be inspired, informed or even confused by the code.
Also be aware that the implementation might not be optimal or state of the
art. Occasionally I'll update it to the latest Compose version.
